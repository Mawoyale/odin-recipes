<p>This is just a recipe for Chicken Stew Creamy</p>

<ol>
  <li>3 leeks , halved and finely sliced</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil , plus extra if needed</li>
  <li>8 small chicken thighs</li>
  <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>75g crème fraîche</li>
  <li>200g frozen peas</li>
  <li>3 tbsp dried or fresh breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>small bunch of parsley , finely chopped</li>
</ol>

<ul>

  <li>STEP 1
    Tip the leeks and oil into a flameproof casserole dish on a low heat, add the butter and cook everything very gently
    for 10 mins or until the leeks are soft.</li>
  <li>STEP 2
    Put the chicken, skin-side down, in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, cook until the skin browns, then
    turn and brown the other side. You shouldn’t need any oil but if the skin starts to stick, add a little. Add the
    chicken to the leeks, leaving behind any fat in the pan.</li>
  <li>STEP 3
    Add the stock to the dish and bring to a simmer, season well, cover and cook for 30 mins on low. Stir in the
    mustard, crème fraîche and peas and bring to a simmer. You should have quite a bit of sauce.</li>
  <li>STEP 4
    When you’re ready to serve, put the grill on. Mix the breadcrumbs and parsley, sprinkle them over the chicken and
    grill until browned.</li>

<p>This is just a recipe for Chicken enchiladas</p>

<ol>
  <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li> red onions, sliced</li>
  <li>2 red peppers, sliced</li>
  <li>3 red chillies, 2 deseeded and chopped, 1 sliced</li>
  <li>small bunch coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly chopped - plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
  <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
  <li>1 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
  <li>6 skinless chicken breasts, cut into small chunks</li>
  <li>415g can refried beans (we used Discovery)</li>
  <li>198g can sweetcorn, drained</li>
  <li>700ml bottle passata</li>
  <li>1 tsp golden caster sugar</li>
  <li>10 tortillas</li>
  <li>2 x 142ml pots soured cream</li>
  <li>200g cheddar, grated</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>STEP 1
    Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in your largest pan, then fry the onions, peppers, chopped chilli and coriander stalks with
    half the garlic for 10 mins until soft. Stir in 2 tsp ground coriander and 2 tsp cumin seeds, then fry for 1 min
    more. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, fry the chicken in the remaining oil, in batches, until browned – add it to
    the pan of veg as it is done.</li>
  <li>STEP 2
    Stir the beans, sweetcorn, coriander leaves and 150ml of the passata into the veg and chicken. In a bowl, mix the
    rest of the passata with the other crushed garlic clove, the remaining spices and the sugar, then set aside.</li>
  <li>STEP 3
    To assemble, lay the tortillas onto a board and divide the chicken mixture between them, folding over the ends and
    rolling up to seal. Divide the passata sauce into the dishes you are using, then top with the enchiladas. Dot over
    the soured cream, sprinkle with grated cheese and scatter with the sliced chilli.</li>
  <li>STEP 4
    Cool and freeze (see freezing tips, below) or, if eating straight away, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, then bake
    for 30 mins, scattering with more coriander leaves to serve, if you like.</li>
