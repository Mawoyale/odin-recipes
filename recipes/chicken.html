<p>This is just a recipe for Chicken Stew Creamy</p>

<ol>
  <li>3 leeks , halved and finely sliced</li>
  <li>2 tbsp olive oil , plus extra if needed</li>
  <li>8 small chicken thighs</li>
  <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
  <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
  <li>75g crème fraîche</li>
  <li>200g frozen peas</li>
  <li>3 tbsp dried or fresh breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>small bunch of parsley , finely chopped</li>
</ol>

<ul>

  <li>STEP 1
    Tip the leeks and oil into a flameproof casserole dish on a low heat, add the butter and cook everything very gently
    for 10 mins or until the leeks are soft.</li>
  <li>STEP 2
    Put the chicken, skin-side down, in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, cook until the skin browns, then
    turn and brown the other side. You shouldn’t need any oil but if the skin starts to stick, add a little. Add the
    chicken to the leeks, leaving behind any fat in the pan.</li>
  <li>STEP 3
    Add the stock to the dish and bring to a simmer, season well, cover and cook for 30 mins on low. Stir in the
    mustard, crème fraîche and peas and bring to a simmer. You should have quite a bit of sauce.</li>
  <li>STEP 4
    When you’re ready to serve, put the grill on. Mix the breadcrumbs and parsley, sprinkle them over the chicken and
    grill until browned.</li>
</ul>
